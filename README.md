# PTSD: Provably Safe Transfer via Domain Randomization 🛡️🤖

**Bridging the Sim-to-Real Gap in Safety-Critical Reinforcement Learning**

Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in the real world—particularly in safety-critical domains—remains a daunting challenge due to the inherent risks of unsafe exploration. While **domain randomization** has shown promise in transferring policies from simulation to reality, it lacks formal safety guarantees.

**PTSD** (Provably Safe Transfer via Domain Randomization) introduces a **theoretically grounded** approach that ensures **constraint satisfaction** even in the presence of **model mismatch**, relying *only* on domain randomization. Our method maintains the **simplicity and scalability** of existing sim-to-real paradigms while providing provable safety during real-world deployment.

### Key Contributions 🚀

- **Theoretical Analysis**: We characterize the limitations of standard domain randomization in safety-critical settings.
- **Provably Safe Transfer**: PTSD ensures constraint satisfaction across sim-to-real transitions without real-world trial-and-error.
- **Real-World Deployment**: We validate our approach on two physical robotic platforms, showing that theory meets practice.

## Requirements 🛠

- **Python** ≥ 3.9
- Recommended environment managers: `venv` or `Poetry`

## Installation 🧩

### Using pip

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ptsd.git
cd ptsd
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
````

### Using Poetry

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ptsd.git
cd ptsd
poetry install
poetry shell
```

## Usage 🧪

To train an RL agent using PTSD:

```bash
python train_ptsd.py --config configs/example.yaml
```

Modify the YAML file to match your environment and constraints.
